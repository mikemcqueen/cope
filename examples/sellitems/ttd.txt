* benchmarks:
  * execute a txn, return immediately
  * execute a txn, eat N messages, return
  * execute a txn, which executes txn that returns immediately
  * execute a txn, process N messages which each executes txn that return immediately

  * with/without std::any
  * with/without std::unique_ptr (including state)
    * small state, large state
    * w and w/o AVX2
  * with/without string msg_name/txn_name (templatize IdT)


* make the sellitems sample more pretty. (?)
* add compiler options (linux especially?)
* support command line -q, -i<iter>
* remove all references to "Broker::*"
* another example. moving average (temperature?) calc + temp control?
  could have different temp control strategies, slow, medium, fast response
  however, this doesn't really solve the "nested state" problem
* "query" message.  queries state?
* "update" message.  updates state?
  * both of these could potentially do all of their work from within
    the promise, if the txn is in "ready" state
