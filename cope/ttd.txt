* txn_complete, use it to encapsulate a msg_ like txn_start?

* can pass state to validate_start, and initialize it there, eliminating one line
* i think get_candidate_row could, what, take **row? i stared at this a bunch. maybe. 
* static member function template? (msg_from<>)
* why am i moving yield result to root_p? why not active_p? it might change on txn_complete?
* consider dp::hresult , with empty named enum, make_hresult(), s_ok, s_false, e_fail
  and succeeded(), failed(), and formatter support
  --OR-- ((bad))
  for now, in dp.h just include platform.h, and using hresult = HRESULT
  and maybe constexpr s_ok, s_false, e_fail 
* sell_item multi-page handler
